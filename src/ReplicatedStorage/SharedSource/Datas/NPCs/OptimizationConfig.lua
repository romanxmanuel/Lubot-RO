	WARNING: UseClientPhysics is an ADVANCED optimization
	- Offloads ALL physics to client
	- Client has full position authority (no anti-exploit validation)
	- Requires extensive testing
	- NOT recommended for beginners

		UseClientPhysics - Enable client-side physics simulation

		CRITICAL WARNINGS:
		1. NO physics on server at all
		2. Client handles ALL pathfinding and movement
		3. Client has full position authority (no validation - prevents ping false positives)
		   >> We accept that clients can manipulate NPC positions
		   >> This is intentional trade-off for smooth gameplay at all ping levels
		4. Only suitable for non-critical NPCs (ambient, visual-only)
		5. Requires more testing for specific use cases
		6. Everything is rendered on client-side for optimization

		When enabled:
		- Server stores positions and health (no HumanoidRootPart, no physics)
		- Health managed by server for gameplay integrity
		- Client calculates pathfinding (using NoobPath)
		- Client simulates jumps (physics simulation)
		- Client handles all physics and movement
		- NPCs only rendered when player is nearby
		- Instead of HumanoidRootPart, only positions are saved

		Performance: Can handle 20+ NPCs with barely any lag, enable with USE_ANIMATION_CONTROLLER for best results
		To handle 1,000+ NPCs: turn USE_ANIMATION_CONTROLLER enabled!

		Security: Client has position authority (no validation - prevents ping-related false positives)
		          Health remains server-authoritative to protect gameplay integrity
		Use Case: Ambient NPCs, crowds, background characters (non-gameplay-critical)

		DO NOT USE FOR:
		- Combat NPCs (enemies, bosses)
		- NPCs that drop loot or rewards
		- NPCs tied to game progression
		- Any NPC that affects gameplay outcomes

		USE_ANIMATION_CONTROLLER - Replace Humanoid with AnimationController

		When enabled (with UseClientPhysics = true):
		- Removes Humanoid from visual models entirely
		- Uses AnimationController for animations (much lighter)
		- Eliminates all Humanoid physics/state overhead

		Performance Impact:
		- Humanoid does ~50+ internal calculations per frame (state machine, physics, etc.)
		- AnimationController only handles animation playback
		- Can reduce CPU usage by 30-50% for large NPC counts

		Requirements:
		- UseClientPhysics must be enabled
		- Health is managed via server values (already implemented)
		- BetterAnimate library supports AnimationController natively

		Trade-offs:
		- No Humanoid.Died event (use Health value instead)
		- No Humanoid.Jumping event (use npcData.IsJumping instead)
		- No automatic ragdoll on death (implement custom if needed)

			TOWER DEFENSE OPTIMIZATION:
			- Lower value (e.g., 0.1) = More frequent updates, smoother NPC movement, but higher server load

			Recommended values:
			- For smooth Tower Defense: 0.1 seconds (10 updates/sec)
			- For low server load and for any other games: 0.5 seconds (2 updates/sec) - current setting
